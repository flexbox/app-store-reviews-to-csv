One thing I will say is that the transferring of money from a bank account to Celsius will take a really long time. The app says it says ~3-5 days for an ACH transfer to go through, but it definitely took a week and some days. Overall the interface is clean and there are some hiccups such as random logouts, but the basic functions of the app work well so I guess I can’t complain too much. I would love to see just better interface capabilities, like a direct link to the Celsius support, since there seems to be none in the app, and whatever else can be thought of. Just add it tbh, the interface is clean and uncluttered but at what cost.;https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1387885523&type=Purple%20Software

Simple.;"So I heard a few of the founder’s interviews and thought he was a pretty standup guy with community as #1. And decided to give this a try. I’ve successfully stored and withdrawn a couple different currencies. And the interest paid every week is legit. I’ve also received a quick response from support. So, 5 stars. But see below. 

I think they have the right ideals in mind and 100% hope they succeed. Although, it does seem to still be a work in progress. I think they made some design choices on the side of keeping it simple to allow for better security in the growth phase. As in, in order to change your withdraw address, you have to contact support. Which, increases security simply... but limits functionality. I get it with the pin.. but that could work better (bring up the number pad). Add face/fingerprint. Also, the 2fa is a little scary because my Authenticator app is on my phone so.. maybe some different options. Compound interest would be great but I also understand they can only do what they can afford, and it seems they’re trying really hard to support community. 

I hope adoption increases. And please please please don’t let development stagnate. I want Celsius to succeed!";https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1387885523&type=Purple%20Software

Alex Mashinsky the founder of CEL and his team are a financial institution that operates in a similar manner to banks. The only difference is Celsius has the community’s best interest in mind and they aren’t driven by greed. They have a business model allows all parties to benefit creating a strong base of happy members, myself included.

All you have to do is create an account and get some crypto into it to start earning weekly interest. Since I began a few months back, seeing the weekly payment into my account really gives me a sense of optimism for my financial future... especially as the entire crypto industry grows. Celsius really gives everyone a fair opportunity to allow your own money to multiply, which is a key to building wealth.

Its not available everywhere and yes some features we would all like to see are still in the pipeline.  Patience will pay off here. IMO the next release which should directly connect your legacy bank account will no doubt allow me to recommend this to people who are not yet familiar with the crypto landscape.

But that is just the crypto part of the journey.

The real thing that following them taught me is just how bad the banks treat us.  I have been earning 7% to 10% or more on my USD.  They show me how they lend out the money and instead of paying it to investors they pay it to depositors.

Talk to your grandparents or just look up what kinds on interest the banks use to pay.  It let the last generation grow their wealth.

I deposited small amounts periodically to see how secure the crypto is in their custody. I’m pleased to say that I am very impressed with their withdrawal process. This app is for storing your BTC and other crypto while earning interest. I can also take out a loan instead of selling my assets. Their fees are ridiculously low. 

The APP has one of the cleanest crypto wallet UI I’ve come across. Test it out and see for yourself. You don’t have to deposit anything. I didn’t for a few weeks. I just played around with the app and it grew on me. 
 
Earning interest on my BTC was the selling point for me. Also, there is no lock-up of 21 days, which puts my mind to rest. 

2FA authentication, email confirmation, and a 24 hour lock for new addresses. So even if someone gained access to my account. They would be unable to withdraw for 24 hours after they change my withdrawal address once the address is confirmed by email and authenticating through 2FA. 

I am thrilled with their services. Instead of just holding my bitcoin, now I can hold and earn interest.

The downside of the app is that it is not localized in that, for example, the max US  earn rates are less as shown because of US restrictions and currently you cannot earn in CEL tokens if in the US.

Lately their 2fa reset process took over a week with their support; only had to reset it after my phone stopped working because their doc tells users not to write down their 2fa key (a weird suggestion that I shouldn’t have listened).

Finally got 2fa reset after a week, but now ui asks for a 6-digit pin while I have a 4-digit pin on record.  I have confirmed with their support that they didn’t trigger reset after making the change from 4 digits to 6 digits for those that had 2fa working at the time like me, which I assume is a sizable number.  Such an oversight on their part: they essentially invalidated people’s pins when they changed to 6 digits without telling them.

I get what Alex is trying to do, but his team is really not great: basically eng/prod team didn’t thoroughly test/think of all cases and support is super slow.

Last week Celsius gave me more interest on my savings than I got from my conventional savings account in the entirety of last year — and the bitcoin appreciates in value at the same time.

I feel safer leaving my crypto in their custody and recommending to others that they do the same than keeping everything in a wallet where I’m paranoid I’ll forget my seed phrase.  No smart contract bug risk, no impermanent loss — just solid safe real yield.

Finally, I can (and have) borrowed up to half the value of my crypto so that I can access funds without having to sell.  It was super easy and want to know my favorite part?  Just let the borrowed money sit there until you need it and the interest you earn on the stable coins is higher than the interest charged to borrow it.  Potentially a great way to lightly leverage your crypto position without much risk of liquidation to buy dips for the long term Hodler.

Celsius wallet is one of the best ways to get started in that direction. You keep your money in a traditional bank and they use it to invest in THEMSELVES no YOU! 

Celsius is build off of a true concept of community. Putting the tools in place for those in the crypto market to build toward their future and also earn rewards while keeping your coin secure. 

I moved from apps like Coinbase that are focused on driving fees, Celsius doesn’t do that, they also help you build yield! Best move I made for my crypto investment and stable coins.

3 stars because it works, but still needs work in parts. 

The Tracker function is a little strange because it lets you save arbitrary values while also holding actual coins in the wallet. “Manage coins” lets you alter the tracker values, but I was unable to delete the test values I entered. Multiple times it has told me “Oops, it looks like something went wrong."" Buggy.

CEL token is available on at least 1 exchange (IDEX) but it’s value is not $0.30… more like $0.05. Seems strange (dishonest?) to display a USD value if its not accurate. Tastes a bit… salty.

The Earn function is also a bit weird because Celsius is supposed to pay interest in the same token that you are holding in the wallet, right? This part of the app starts with a USD estimate for some reason. So, you could earn 4.25% on Bitcoin, but it does NOT display estimated interest in Bitcoin. Why?

Did it just how you’re supposed to. Went to click send and it tells me to go to email to verify the withdrawal address, rather to confirm it. So upon doing so they locked me out of it for the next 24 hrs.  For my security.

I’m not interested one bit in giving up any freedom for any security. That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard. I really didn’t need more government to keep me safe, thanks.

So if you are like me and transferred money into the app... you can’t access it , look at it or anything.  Your money at this point is just inaccessible and that is unacceptable!;https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1387885523&type=Purple%20Software

I have experienced occasional bugs, but they seem to be noticed and patched regularly. I really appreciate an easy spreadsheet export for tax purposes- seriously, why can’t coinbase do this?

The idea and business model behind the app are so strong that they eclipse any temporary app-related issues. One improvement I would like to see is the ability to purchase tokens of any of their supported wallets, not just a small handful. Would also like to see the US added to the fold re: CEL token earn, but understand there are some serious regulatory hurdles to navigate still.

The promo codes are excellent and can stack!

After not getting a reply from support I looked through other reviews to see that I had seriously misjudged Celsius. I ultimately paid with my money so I hope this review saves others the headache and your wallet.

1. They straight up never delivered my ETH(put in the correct address according to Celsius)

2. A lot of bad reviews and a number of FAKE positive reviews, You will notice the fake ones don’t get developer responses and have numbers at the end of their name. That’s a huge red flag for a scam.

3. Customer support is non existent 

4.(Yet to experience) They seem to not be truthful about the actual cost of the transaction, it turning out to be higher then quoted.

You can NOT earn CEL (look it up) if you are an American. That would have been fine had they followed that “compliance issue” from day one. 

Also, they hold on to withdrawals for at least 24 hrs. So if you don’t wish to hold for the long run than don’t bother with Celsius. Hopefully Apple does not censor this review, it is my first hand account.

I'm certain new features will come for US citizens some day, but for what I use it for - hodling, its a great tool 😁🔨
